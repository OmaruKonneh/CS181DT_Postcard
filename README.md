# Postcard Pinboard: A Creative Way to Relive and Share Your Adventures

Welcome to **Postcard Pinboard**, a unique app designed to help you document, personalize, and share your travel memories in a visually stunning and interactive way. Our app focuses on expanding the postcard concept, allowing users to creatively showcase their trips while offering useful insights for others.


# Project Overview

Initially, our app combined an itinerary planner powered by AI with a postcard feature for memory-keeping. However, through user feedback and instructor evaluations, we realized this combination lacked cohesion and limited creativity. To address these concerns, we decided to focus solely on enhancing the **postcard feature**, expanding it into a more interactive and personalized experience.

# Key Features
**Interactive Travel Map**: Display your trip as a series of pins on a chronological map, tracing your path like a detectiveâ€™s pinboard.

**Integrated Media and Notes**: Attach photos, videos, and notes to each pin for detailed documentation.

**Customizable Pathway**: Add descriptions of what went well, what you would do differently, or just share how you felt.
